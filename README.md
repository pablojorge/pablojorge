### Welcome!

Here you'll find some toy projects and random (and old) tests.

The two most active projects are:

 - ["Price Tracker"](./pablojorge/price-tracker): Written in Node.js, provides both a REST and a WebSockets API, using Redis as storage, plus a frontend built with JQuery+Bootstrap (kinda old-school now...). Offers spot and historical prices for fiat currencies, crypto currencies and gold/silver. See it live [here](http://price-tracker.herokuapp.com/).
 - ["Brainfuck"](./pablojorge/brainfuck): A collection of BF interpreters/translators in C/C++/ASM/JS/Python/Rust + others. The JS version includes an interactive "IDE" (check it [here](http://pablojorge.github.io/brainfuck/), it lets you choose between a pure JS or a [WebAssembly](./pablojorge/brainfuck/wasm) engine). There's also a C++ JIT implementation. See more about it in this [post](https://pablojorge.github.io/blog/2020/07/27/bf-jit-compiler-in-cpp.html).
