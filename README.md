### Welcome!

Here you'll find some toy projects and old experiments (what I do when I'm not doing real stuff for [@Blockchain](https://github.com/blockchain))

The two most active projects are:

 - ["Price Tracker"](./pablojorge/price-tracker): Written in Node.js, provides both a REST and a WebSocket API, using Redis as storage, plus a frontend built with JQuery+Bootstrap (kinda old-school now...). Offers spot and historical prices for fiat currencies, crypto currencies and gold/silver, from multiple sources. See it live [here](http://price-tracker.herokuapp.com/).
 - ["Brainfuck"](./pablojorge/brainfuck): A collection of BF interpreters/translators in C/C++/ASM/JS/Python/Rust + others. The JS version includes an interactive "IDE" (check it [here](http://pablojorge.github.io/brainfuck/), it lets you choose between a pure JS or a [WebAssembly](./pablojorge/brainfuck/blob/master/wasm) engine). There's also a "handmade" [C++ JIT](./pablojorge/brainfuck/blob/master/cpp/brainfuck-jit.cpp) implementation (see more about it in this [post](https://pablojorge.github.io/blog/2020/07/27/bf-jit-compiler-in-cpp.html))
