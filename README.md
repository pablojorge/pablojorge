### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
Here you'll find some toy projects and random tests.

The two main and relatively active projects are:
 - [Price Tracker](./price-tracker): Written in Node.js, provides a REST and a WebSockets APIs + a frontend in JQuery+Bootstrap, using Redis for storage. Offers spot and historical prices for fiat currencies, crypto currencies and gold/silver.
   See it live in: <http://price-tracker.herokuapp.com/>
 - [Brainfuck](./brainfuck): A collection of BF interpreters/translators in C/C++/ASM/JS/Python/Rust + others.
   The JS version includes an "IDE" you can check in <http://pablojorge.github.io/brainfuck/>. It lets you choose between a pure JS or a [WebAssembly](./brainfuck/wasm) engine.
   There's also a C++ JIT implementation (see more in <https://pablojorge.github.io/blog/2020/07/27/bf-jit-compiler-in-cpp.html>)
